## About Me

My name is Dillon Gyotoku. I am a sophomore Industrial Engineering student at the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington and I was born and raised in the Seattle area. I also have strong ties to Oahu, Hawaii, where my dad's family lives- we take a trip down every year.

I am currently working part-time as a coding instructor, teaching C# through Unity online. I have taught students in Java, JavaScript, Lua, HTML/CSS, C#, and Scratch, and got this position during my junior year of high school. At the time, I was unsure what type of engineering I wanted to pursue, and chose to take this position to improve my coding skills and become exposed to a variety of languages which could help me in any engineering field. As a longtime employee and team leader, I work directly with the business owner as well as my coworkers to coordinate class schedules, assist students, and create curriculum for our summer camps.

This school year, I officially became an Industrial Engineering student and began pursing the Data Science specialization.  During my first year, I didn't feel connected to many of the traditional engineering types, but I have always enjoyed working with and analyzing different types of data. I am someone who is always excited to try out new methods and likes using data collection and analysis to not only determine but also implement solutions to complex problems, and that led me to connect with Industrial Engineering almost immediately. Academically, I am committed to my education and excel in my studies with a GPA of 3.66. In the past, I've enjoyed courses on Technical Writing, Industrial Systems, and Computer Programming.

In addition to class and work, I attend clubs and generally seek out opportunities to expand my knowledge. I'm currently in the process of obtaining a Six Sigma Green Belt certification, and I have run and analyzed several online surveys over the last two years. I am experienced with using Excel, but also recently began branching out to learning R and the statistics analysis software JMP. I also have some interest in the graphic design of events like the Olympics and video editing. In my free time, I enjoy reading, listening to music, exercising, or playing videogames.

## Analytical Writing Samples

### Education Pain Point Analysis

- This piece was written as part of a group of 4 in the fall of 2021. We were asked to investigate and analyze pain points in the student experience during the Covid-19 era. For this project, I was in charge of data analysis, and used R to create the visualizations included in the final product. It was my first time using R, so I used this experience to practice with the language and tried out several different charts. I wrote the entire Findings section, as well as much of the Discussion, where I explained how the results of my analysis affected my group's decisionmaking process. I also led our group's communication efforts via Discord and edited the entire final draft of the project.

### Business CSR Report

- This piece was written with one partner during January of 2019. We were asked to investigate and analyze the corporate social responsibility of a local dentist's office, and then propose a plan for how the business could improve its corporate social responsibility. For this project, my partner and I interviewed the business owner, then surveyed both customers and employees and used the data to create the Eastview Community Outreach Plan. This plan included a 6-month timeline, budget, and analysis of the business and its surrounding environment, and recommended various activities for the business to improve its corporate social responsibility. I handled the data analysis using Excel and was responsible for interviewing the business owner, and worked with my partner on all of the report material. We presented this plan to the business owner and at DECA competitions, where we finished as Washington State Finalists.

## Other Project Samples

### CRISPR Ethical Analysis

- This piece was written as part of a group of 4 in Spring 2021. We were asked to analyze and propose solutions to ethical dilemmas surrounding the gene editing technology CRISPR. I served as the team leader and was personally responsible for writing the sections What is CRISPR?, How CRISPR Works, Using CRISPR to Revive Extinct Species, The Benefits and Risks for Humans and Natural Ecosystems, and the report's Cover Page. I also served as the primary editor for the piece, collected sources for other students, and coordinated our work via Slack. Due to some group members not being native English speakers or unresponsive, this meant that I was occasionally responsible for picking up extra work or rewriting other sections, as well as formatting the document.

### Browse and Build Camp

- This is a summer camp that I designed with one coworker during Summer 2019 for my current position as a coding instructor. The curriculum is designed for students aged 4-14 and covers HTML, CSS, and a short introduction to JavaScript. Students learn about basic tags, create their own webpages listing their favorite things, and also work with the Weebly website builder. I modeled the student projects after my own experiences in a highschool web design class, and included code samples. I also updated the curriculum so that it could be taught online in the summer of 2021 and compiled resources for future learning, such as W3Schools, into an email that is sent home to parents. This is only one of many summer camps I have worked on- I have also worked with others on camps that teach JavaScript, Roblox/Lua, and Scratch. In additon, I have personally designed two camps, Minecraft Create and Minecraft Modding, that teach 3D modeling and Minecraft modding skills respectively. Overall, during the course of my time at Code Ninjas, my camps have been used to teach over 500 students and increased our profits by 20%.
