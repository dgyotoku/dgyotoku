            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Dillon Gyotoku. I am a junior in the Industrial Engineering program at the University of
                Washington in Seattle, Washington who is also pursing a specialization in Data Science. I was born and
                raised just outside Seattle in Newcastle, but also frequently travel down to Honolulu, Hawaii to visit my dad's side of
                the family.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently working part-time as a coding instructor, teaching C# through Unity online. I
                have taught students in Java, JavaScript, Lua, HTML/CSS, C#, and Scratch. I chose this position
                to improve my coding skills and become exposed to a variety of languages which could help me in
                any engineering field. As a longtime employee and team leader, I work directly with the business
                owner and my coworkers to coordinate class schedules, assist students, and create curriculum
                for our summer camps.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the past year, I also became a research assistant at the University of Washington's Mechatronics,
                Automation, and Control Systems (MACS) Lab. I'm currently working on analyzing laser powder bed
                fusion images for defects using machine learning models trained using Python, specifically the PyTorch
                libary. This project has given me a brand new experience working with and analyzing new types of data
                that I wouldn't see in a classroom setting, and presents exactly the kind of problems that first drew
                me to Industrial Engineering. Academically, I am committed to my education and excel in my studies 
                with a GPA of 3.80. Some of my favorite courses so far have been Technical Writing, Manufacturing
                Systems, and Data Programming. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to class and work, I attend clubs and generally seek out opportunities to expand my
                knowledge. I obtained my Six Sigma Green Belt certification in January 2022, and I've gotten the chance
                to test my Python skills in the MACS lab. I am experienced with using Excel, and also recently
                began branching out to learning R. My current goal is to accumulate experience with simulation programs
                such as Simio and FlexSim throughout the fall quarter and beyond.
            </p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading,
                listening to music, exercising, and playing video games.</p>

            <h3>Machine Learning Model Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                This piece was written as a solo project in the summer of 2022. As part of my Data Programming class,
                I was asked to work with an external dataset and go beyond the bounds of the class to learn something
                new in Python. I was able to combine this with my work in the MACS lab, and I chose to compare and
                contrast different cropping strategies and model frameworks to determine if changing these elements
                produced a more accurate and therefore more useful model. All data processing and analysis was written
                by me, and my mentor at the MACS lab assisted during the training process to make sure that the models
                were viable for comparison.

            <h3>Root Cause Analysis Slide Deck</h3>
            <p>
                This slide deck was created as part of a group of 3 in the spring of 2022. We were asked to succinctly
                present the basics of Root Cause Analysis to the class and run an activity to demonstrate the process
                in action. For this project, I was in charge of conducting much of the research, which included finding
                strong, studied examples from industry as well as historical facts. I also had a leading role working
                with our professor to devise and conduct our activity for the class and ensuring that our presentation
                slides were visually discinct and easy to understand.

            <h3>Education Pain Point Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                This piece was written as part of a group of 4 in the fall of 2021. We were asked to investigate and
                analyze pain points in the student experience during the Covid-19 era. For this project, I was in charge
                of data analysis, and used R to create the visualizations included in the final product. It was my first
                time using R, so I used this experience to practice with the language and tried out several different
                charts. I wrote the entire Findings section, as well as much of the Discussion, where I explained how the
                results of my analysis affected my group's decisionmaking process. I also led our group's communication
                efforts via Discord and edited the entire final draft of the project.

            <h3>CRISPR Ethical Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                This piece was written as part of a group of 4 in Spring 2021. We were asked to analyze and propose solutions
                to ethical dilemmas surrounding the gene editing technology CRISPR. I served as the team leader and was
                personally responsible for writing the sections What is CRISPR?, How CRISPR Works, Using CRISPR to Revive
                Extinct Species, The Benefits and Risks for Humans and Natural Ecosystems, and the report's Cover Page.
                I also served as the primary editor for the piece, collected sources for other students, and coordinated our
                work via Slack. Due to some group members not being native English speakers or unresponsive, this meant that
                I was occasionally responsible for picking up extra work or rewriting other sections, as well as formatting the document.

            <h3>Browse and Build Camp</h3>
            <p>
                This is a summer camp that I designed with one coworker during summer 2019 and updated in summer 2021 
                for my current position as a coding instructor. The curriculum is designed for students aged 4-14 and
                covers HTML, CSS, and a short introduction to JavaScript. Students learn about basic tags, create their
                own webpages listing their favorite things, and also work with the Weebly website builder. I modeled 
                the student projects after my own experiences in a high school web design class, and included code samples.
                I also compiled resources for future learning, such as W3Schools, into an email that is sent home to 
                parents. This is only one of many summer camps I have worked on- I have also worked with others on camps
                that teach JavaScript, Roblox/Lua, and Scratch. In addition, I have personally designed two camps, 
                Minecraft Create and Minecraft Modding, that teach 3D modeling and Minecraft modding skills respectively.

            <h3>Business CSR Report</h3>
            <p>
                This piece was written with one partner during January of 2019. We were asked to investigate and analyze
                the corporate social responsibility of a local dentist's office, and then propose a plan for how the business
                could improve its corporate social responsibility. For this project, my partner and I interviewed the
                business owner, then surveyed both customers and employees and used the data to create the Eastview Community
                Outreach Plan. This plan included a 6-month timeline, budget, and analysis of the business and its surrounding
                environment, and recommended various activities for the business to improve its corporate social responsibility.
                I handled the data analysis using Excel and was responsible for interviewing the business owner, and worked
                with my partner on all of the report material. We presented this plan to the business owner and at DECA
                competitions, where we finished as Washington State Finalists.
